= JAX-RS Analyzer
Sebastian Daschner

Generates an overview of all JAX-RS resources in a project by bytecode analysis.

*Yet another such JAX-RS plugin?* +
Yes, but this tool gathers the information about the JAX-RS resource classes by bytecode analysis (not just by reflection).
This gains more information in several situations.

== Maven Plugin

The Analyzer can be added to your project via https://github.com/sdaschner/jaxrs-analyzer-maven-plugin[Maven plugin].

== Swagger Backend

One of the output formats of the REST documentation is the heavily used Swagger API format. The tool creates the JSON file which can be loaded with Swagger UI.
